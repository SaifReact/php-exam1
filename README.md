Live Test: Odd or Even Number Checker (Console-Based PHP)


You will create a simple console-based program in PHP to check whether a number entered by the user is odd or even .



Instructions
Input a Number

Prompt the user to enter a single number.

Validate the input to ensure it is a valid integer. If invalid, display an error message and ask the user to re-enter the number.

Check Odd or Even

Use the modulus operator (%) to determine if the number is odd or even:

A number is even if number % 2 == 0.

A number is odd if number % 2 != 0.

Display Result

Display the result clearly:

Example: "The number 4 is Even."

Example: "The number 7 is Odd."

Exit Option

Allow the user to exit the program by typing exit when prompted for input.

If the user chooses to continue, they can check another number.

Menu-Driven Interface

Use a loop to allow repeated checks until the user decides to exit.

Important Notes :

‚úÖ Your code logic must work correctly.

‚ùå Extra features will NOT increase your score.



‚ö†Ô∏è Restrictions (Must Follow) : 

üö® Do NOT modify or remove the provided template structure, function names, variable names, arrays, or objects ..etc.

‚úÖ You can add more functions, variables, or additional logic if necessary, but the existing template must remain unchanged.

Template : 

<?php

// Main program loop

while (true) {

	echo "=== Odd or Even Checker ===\n";

	echo "Enter a number (or type 'exit' to quit): ";

	$input = trim(fgets(STDIN));



	// Exit condition

	if () {

	}



	// Validate input

	if () {

	}



	// Convert input to integer if needed



	// Check if the number is odd or even

	if () {

	} else {

	}

}
